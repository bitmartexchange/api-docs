### Note

The websocket feed is publicly available, but connections to it are rate-limited to 1 per 4 seconds per IP.


### Protocol Overview

The websocket feed uses a bidirectional protocol, which encodes all messages as JSON objects.

**Error messages:** Most failure cases will cause an **error** message (a message with the field "message") to be emitted. This can be helpful for implementing a client or debugging issues.

### Subscribe

To begin receiving feed messages, you must first send a **subscribe** message to the server indicating which channels and products to receive. This message is mandatory â€” you will be disconnected if no **subscribe** has been received within 5 seconds.

Once a **subscribe** message is received, the server will respond with a subscription message along with the channel you are subscribed to.

A sample subscription message looks like:

```js
{
    "subscribe":"trade",
    "symbol":"BMX_ETH",
    "precision":6
}
```

Subsequent subscribe messages will add to the list of subscriptions. For example,

```js
{
    "subscribe":"trade",
    "precision":6,
    "symbol":"BMX_ETH",
    "data":{
        "trades":[
            {
                "side":"buy",
                "amount":"2.55882000",
                "price":"0.000110",
                "count":"23262.00",
                "time":1532018002502
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
}
```

If you want to unsubscribe from channel/product pair, send an **unsubscribe**. The structure is equvalent to **subscribe** messages.

Once **unsubscription** succeed, you will no longer receive subsequent **subscription** messages of the pair.
